# summery of the mission
This project demonstrates how to integrate Celery with Flask using flask_restful for a simple "fire and forget" task system. Although working with Celery was a new experience for me and involved a lot of fast learning and decision-making, this project represents some interesting design choices that can be translated from my previous experience.

# Key Features
## Abstract Celery Task Object
Scalability: The use of an abstract Celery task object allows for better scalability. By defining a base task class with abstract methods, itâ€™s easier to extend and create new task types. This design pattern promotes code reusability and simplifies the addition of new tasks.

## Readable and Manageable Code
Celery and Flask-RESTful: The integration of Celery with flask_restful provides a clean and organized way to manage the task execution and status endpoints. This setup enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage the task system and integrate it with Flask applications.

## Modular Design
Separation of Concerns: The design promotes modularity by separating task definitions and route handlers into different files. This approach makes the codebase easier to navigate and maintain, as each component has a clear and distinct responsibility.

## Error Handling and Robustness
Graceful Error Handling: The application includes error handling for task triggering and status checking, ensuring that any issues are communicated clearly through HTTP responses. This robustness improves the reliability and user experience of the API.
